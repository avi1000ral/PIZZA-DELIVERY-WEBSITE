$content="<h3>NewYork Pizza</h3>
<p>
While New York-style pizza isn’t exactly the original, it’s become the most popular
and widespread choice in the
United States. Even though Neapolitan and New York pizzas share similarities,
there are distinct differences.
Some people will tell you that it’s the minerals in the Big Apple’s water used to
make the dough that makes
this pizza stand out. However, in order to make a proper New York-style pie, the
crust still needs to be thin,
like a Neapolitan, but thick enough to fold a slice in half lengthwise. This
simplifies eating the pizza without
utensils, which is a necessity in New York City's fast-paced setting.

<h3>Chicago Pizza</h3>
<p>
Chicago pizza, also commonly referred to as deep-dish pizza, gets its name from
the city it was invented in.
During the early 1900’s, Italian immigrants in the windy city were searching for
something similar to the
Neapolitan pizza that they knew and loved. Instead of imitating the notoriously
thin pie, Ike Sewell had
something else in mind. He created a pizza with a thick crust that had raised
edges, similar to a pie, and
ingredients in reverse, with slices of mozzarella lining the dough followed by
meat, vegetables, and then
topped with a can of crushed tomatoes. This original creation led Sewell to create
the now famous chain
restaurant, Pizzeria Uno.</p>
<h3>California Pizza </h3>
<p>
California pizza, or gourmet pizza, is known for its unusual ingredients. This pizza
got its start back in the late
1970’s when Chef Ed LaDou began experimenting with pizza recipes in the classic
Italian restaurant, Prego.
By chance, he served one of his newest creations, mustard, ricotta, pate, and red
pepper, to Wolfgang Puck.
Impressed with LaDou’s innovative pie, Puck invited him to be a head pizza chef
at his restaurant. It was here
that LaDou came up with over 250 unique pizza recipes that eventually formed
the menu of chain restaurant,
California Pizza Kitchen.
